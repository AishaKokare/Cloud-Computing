Slip No. 7
Q. Write a program for web feed. 

1) Define the source, by the channel tag
The channel will be the same for all your RSS feeds. These tags are required:
- title: the title of your website, may be the one in the title tag of the home page.
- link: the URL of your website: example: https://www.xul.fr
2) Add an image
This is optional. Design a small image (88x31 for example) in a common format (gif, jpg, png) and put in into the same directory that the RSS file.
The "image" tag is a sub-element of the channel tag
- url is the address of the image itself.
- link is the address of the page displayed when one clicks on the image.
3) Add a new
Now, we will add a web page to display an information. This is an "item" tag, a sub-element of channel, and this components are required:
- title: the title of the article.
- link: the URL of the page.
4) Add more items
More items may be added to this channel.

5) Upload the file
Put the feed.xml file into your website, among other web pages.
6) Validate the file
You may use this online RSS feed validator.
7) Make it available
This is accomplished by adding an RSS button on the home page. A click on the button should display the XML file you have created
8) Updating the feed
To publish further articles, you have just to add items, and remove older ones to keep the number of articles constant.
